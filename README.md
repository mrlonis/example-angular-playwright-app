## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

### Setting up Playwright for E2E Testing

Below is the terminal output when adding Playwright to the Angular project via `npm run ng -- e2e`:

```shell
➜  example-angular-playwright-app git:(main) ✗ npm run ng -- e2e

> example-angular-playwright-app@0.0.0 ng
> ng e2e

Cannot find "e2e" target for the specified project.
You can add a package that implements these capabilities.

For example:
  Playwright: ng add playwright-ng-schematics
  Cypress: ng add @cypress/schematic
  Nightwatch: ng add @nightwatch/schematics
  WebdriverIO: ng add @wdio/schematics
  Puppeteer: ng add @puppeteer/ng-schematics

Would you like to add a package with "e2e" capabilities now? Playwright

## Running Linting via ESLint

To run linting on your project using ESLint, execute the following command:

```bash
ng lint
```

### Setting up ESLint

Below is the terminal output when adding ESLint to the Angular project via `npm run ng -- add angular-eslint`:

```shell
➜  example-angular-playwright-app git:(main) npm run ng -- add angular-eslint

> example-angular-playwright-app@0.0.0 ng
> ng add angular-eslint

✔ Determining Package Manager
  › Using package manager: npm
✔ Searching for compatible package version
  › Found compatible package version: angular-eslint@20.4.0.
✔ Loading package information from registry
✔ Confirming installation
✔ Installing package

    All angular-eslint dependencies have been successfully installed 🎉

    Please see https://github.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint for how to add ESLint configuration to your project.

    We detected that you have a single project in your workspace and no existing linter wired up, so we are configuring ESLint for you automatically.

    Please see https://github.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint for more information.
